# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Goals
- this was meant to teach me about the basics of huffman coding which I totally didn't learn about watching silicon valley
- I also wanted to write an interactive REACT app because I find this technology very interesting
- This also taught me about some data structures like minHeap and Binary Tree alongside the creation and traversal of them.

# Components you will find that I have implemented the minHeap and Tree datastructure myself because I was not satisfied with any of the libraries present online.
